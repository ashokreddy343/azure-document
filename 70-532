Design and implement webstes
	Deploy websites
		Defininf deployment slots
			total of five deployment slots
			staged deployment
			Incremental deployment
			Rolling back deployment
			all deployment slots for a given website share the same web hosting plan and created
			within the same VM(virtual machine) isntance that is hosting the production slot
			Because same VM instance is used for all slots.
			you cannot create a deployment slot with the Free,Shared, and Basic modes.
		Creating hosting plans
			Each web hosting plan is configured with a pricing tier,and each tier describes its
			own set of capabilities and cost.
			A web hosting plan is unique to the region,resource group and subscription.
			Web hosting plans are create as a part of website creation and are not created directly.
			Multiple websites can be hosted within a single web hosting plan
Why Virtual Networks?
	Virtual networks act as a communication channel between resources launched in the cloud.
	Why virtual Because there are no physical wires involved in connecting these resources.
	An VNet is a representation of your own network in the cloud.
	it is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud dedicated to your subscription

What are Azure Subnets ?			
	Each Virtual Network can be divided into subparts,these sub parts are called subnets.
	Subnets are further configured using Network Security Groups.
Network Security Groups
	NSGs are just like firewalls,which filter the traffic coming in,and going out of your VMs.
	These settings can be done easily using Azure.



Microsoft Azure Authentication Scenarios for Developers
=======================================================
Azure Authentication and Azure Active Directory
	What is wrong with Active Directory ?
		Kerberos,NTLM,Group Policies protocal used to authenticate users
		it works very well for its inteended use
		AD is great for on-premises
		Ad is not suitable for internet scale and requirments
	What is Azure AD ?
		Azure Ad is not a replacement for AD
		it can work with AD,it does not need an AD
		suitable for the cloud
		supports modern authentication protocols
		Comes with SDKs for most platforms
		support B2C,B2B,B2E,and numerous Saas applications
		you can sync on-premises identites to the cloud
		you can federate authentication to on-premises
